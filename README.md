# JEEDocumentSimilarity
This is a project for 4th Year Software Development module Advanced Object Oriented Programming. The project is a JEE application for measuring the similarity of two or more documents.  

*De Bello Gallico* and *War and Peace* obtained through [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/).  

### Problems  
Issues with ServiceHandler / ServicePoll Handler - no changes made to either of these files shows up when the index.jsp page is run. Seems to be using a cached version - have tried deleting work folder/deleting webapps folder/restarting tomcat/making new war file/running in browser instead of eclipse/clearing web browser cache, none have worked. Still working on it. No errors/warnings displaying in these files either (red/yellow underlines), even when syntax is definitely wrong (found it unusual to have 0 warnings, typed "sdfhskjd" under a line of code, no red line showed up).  
Currently unable to make these classes do anything different but will keep trying.
